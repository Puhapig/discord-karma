## Wishlist

This is an ordered list of stuff I want to implement in KarmaBot:

- Reasons for upvotes/downvotes are saved to db (and accessible from a command)
- Every user gets a karma quota per day (3 combined upvote/downvote)
- Multiple karma grants in a single message
- Bot replies to & reacts to upvotes/downvotes to the bot
- Weekly/daily summary of karma gain and loss
- Karma graphs
